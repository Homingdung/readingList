Please forgive me for being long-winded since every book here has kept a memory of my story.

## Mathematics:
Books I read:
+ *Calculus* by James Stewart  
 > I am sure that this is one of the most famous calculus books in the world.  

+ *Thomas's Calculus* by George B. Thomas
> I refered more on this book when I was learning the multiple integrals part, compared to the one written by James Stewart.

+ 'Vector Calculus' - It was my primary reference book for my second year and the author Paul is from our school. This book is so fantastic that my notes on this book even cover the whole texts!
+ 'Advanced Engineering Mathematics' by Erwin Kreyszig - This books gave me a good start of learning Differential equations from my first year in the unviersity, now it was more like a tool book for me to refer some concepts I learnt quickly. However, I haven't read the part E, F, G.
+ 'Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos' by Steven H. Strogatz - It is this book that brings me to the nonlinear beauty of this world. Steven has another book called 'Infinite powers', which makes me know the how powful calculus is.
+ 'Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an Introduction to Chaos' by Morris/Stephen/Robert - I still remember that I use this book to teach myself about nonlinear dynamics and the end of 2020. I've gained a basic roadmap of learning dynamical system for my further study because of this book. It is also this book that make me to choose course *Mathematical Biology and Medicine* for my final year study due to the Hodgkin-Huxley model in this book.
+ 'Complex Variables and Application' by James Ward Brown and Ruel V.Churchill - This book is mainly used as an exercise book for me to practice the skills like Taylor series and Residues theorem. Excellent example in this book, isn't it? This book's hard cover has been destroyed due to a serious fire accident happend in my house. I could still remember that I chose to go back to my room, which was coverd by fire and smoke, to take this book with me out even though I escaped from the fire successfully at the first time.
+ 'Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems' by Boyce/Diprima/Meade - This is my primary reference book when I was learning the course *Differential equation and fouier analysis*. I learnt lots of advanced skills for applied mathematics. This book saved my life when I was quite struggling with the solution of Bessel's equations and legrendre's equation.
+ 'Introduction to Linear Algebra' by Gilbert Strang - I took the corresponding online open courses when I was learning the linear algebra. Gilbert's new way to start linear algebra is quite attractive. I also read serveval chapters of his book *Differential Equations with Linear Algebra*.
+ 'A First Course in Probability' by Sheldon Ross -
